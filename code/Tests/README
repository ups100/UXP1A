	/********************************************************
	*	TestProgram and Scripts/* scripts information:	*
	********************************************************/

Those test assume that server is run and it's clear from any tuples inside
Also assume that file structure of data and scripts are not changed
It's important to provide testProgram called in the same way into Scripts/ directory


Test program is written to be run in a specific way -> specific args so,
it suppose to show debug information about what is happening during the test
like what is pushed, what pulled etc, and what timeout or sleep is on for what time.

On the end on test with those args, there is printed string with 0 and 1
1 means that operation has been successful
0 means timeout


4 tests are defined:
	1_test:	push specified int tuples
		3 other process try to get them
		each tuple should be get once
	2_test:	same as 1_test but first one process preview all tuples
		each tuple should be get once
	3_test:	push specified mixed tuples
		each process can get prepared for it tuple
		last tuple is single so it can be received by anyone
		each tuple should be get once
	4_test:	push specified int tuples
		each process get int:*
		amount of pulled tuples == amount of pushed tuples =>
		=> each tuple should be get once
	5_test: do not push any tuple
		one process try to pull some data
		amount of pulled tuples should be 0
	6_test:	run process which push some tuple
		next it pull it, push some, pull that, and so on
		final result should be as sequence with only 1 inside eg. 111..11

More info in X_test.sh scripts

Those args are:
bool Whether we want to show menu and other couts
uint Random sleep from 0 to given value after each operation, 0 if no sleep
uint Random timeout from 0 to given value instead of specified timeout in data file, 0 if wanted to use value from data file
uint Random sleep from 0 to given value after each successful pull operation, 0 if no sleep
